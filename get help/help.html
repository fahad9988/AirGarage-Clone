            <p>AirGarage partners with churches, small businesses, and hotels to manage and monetize their parking lots. <br> <br>

                As a renter, you can rent a spot any time their lot is not in use or there are extra spots available. Sometimes their parking lot may be closed for customer use only. <br> <br>
                
                AirGarage charges a one hour minimum for every lot (regardless of if you stay less than an hour) due to credit card processing fees. The price is prorated every minute after the first hour.</p>

                    It is most likely just an issue with the license plate on file not matching the license plate we scanned in the parking lot. No big deal, and we'll be glad to investigate and get it fixed for you.</p>

                                If your plate was scanned and your rental was not started within the 5 minute buffer time, we will start one for you as a courtesy. <br> <br>

                                    During events, the number of spots we have to sell to you may be reduced by lot owners. <br> <br>
