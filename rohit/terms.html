          <strong>General Terms</strong> <br />
          a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This agreement
          ("Agreement") is between AirGarage (“Us” or “We”) and a user (“You”)
          of the AirGarage website (“Website”) about the services (“Services”)

          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
          user may have an account (“Account”) created for them so that they can
          act as a buyer ("Buyer"), that is someone who has booked or intends to
          book a parking space ("Parking Space") or act as a Seller ("Seller"),
          that is, the owner or operator of the Parking Space which is to be
          listed or has been listed. <br />
          b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may amend these terms
          from time to time. Any amendments or new terms and conditions will be
          provided to you. You may terminate this Agreement if you do not wish
          to be bound by any such amendments but by continuing to use our
          Website you will be deemed to have accepted the new terms. <br />
          c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By entering into this
          Agreement, you also agree to our Privacy Policy which is available on

          e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You agree that these terms
          are fair and reasonable in all circumstances. However, if any
          provision of this Agreement is prohibited by law or judged by a court
          to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, the provision shall, to the
          extent required, be severed from this Agreement and rendered
          ineffective as far as possible without modifying the remaining
          provisions of this Agreement, and shall not in any way affect any
          other circumstances of or the validity or enforcement of this
          Agreement. <br />
          f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No delay on the part of
          either party in enforcing against the other party any term or
          condition of this Agreement shall either be or be deemed to be a
          waiver or in any way prejudice any right of that party under this
          Agreement. <br />

          bugs, viruses, Trojan horses, or the like, which may be transmitted to
          or through the Website by any third party, or for any loss or damage
          of any kind incurred as a result of your use of the Website or
          Services, however caused and under any theory of liability (including
          negligence), even if advised of the possibility of such damages.
          <br />
          b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You acknowledge that the
          amounts payable under this Agreement are based in part on these
          limitations, and You further agree that these limitations will apply
          notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of any limited
          remedy. The foregoing limitation of liability shall apply to the
          fullest extent permitted by law in the applicable jurisdiction. <br />
          c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No claim may be brought
          against us in relation to this Agreement more than 1 months following
          the Booking to which the claim relates. <br />
          d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will not be liable to
          you in the event of a claim by a Buyer or Seller against you and, for

          is a platform for advertising Parking Spaces owned or controlled by

          administering and confirming Bookings and collecting payment on behalf
          of the Seller. <br />
          b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we endeavor to
          ensure that Parking Spaces listed on the Website are of a high quality
          we offer no guarantee as to the Parking Space's suitability for the
          Buyer’s requirements. Similarly, we rely on the Seller for details
          about a Parking Space given on the Website and whilst we use
          <br />reasonable efforts to verify the accuracy of such information we
          offer no warranty in relation to these details.
          c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Buyer is only able to
          book a Parking Space advertised on the Website once agreed by the
          Seller. The listing for a Parking Space will indicate the
          availability, price and location of the Parking Space.

          j. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We make great efforts to
          ensure that our Sellers offer a good service and provide their Parking
          Space in accordance with Buyer expectations but we accept no
          responsibility and will have no liability if the Parking Space or the
          services of the Seller generally do not meet the requirements of the
          Buyer or. The right of action or claim in such circumstances will be
          against the Seller but we may assist (at our discretion) in seeking to
          resolve a dispute between the Buyer and the Seller. <br />

          and any existing Account you may have.<br />
          e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon termination, you will
          no longer be able to use our Services or make Bookings through us. If

        agrees to permit the Buyer to use the Parking Space.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          This leasing agreement ("Agreement") is between the Buyer ("Buyer")
          who has booked a Parking Space through the AirGarage website
          (“Website”) and the owner or operator ("Seller") of the parking space

        </li>

        <li>
          This Agreement and any additional terms included in a Seller's listing

        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>The Booking Process</strong><br />

          a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement becomes
          binding on the Buyer and the Seller when the Seller accepts the terms
          of a Booking as communicated by AirGarage and when the Buyer requests
          a booking and payment is received by AirGarage. <br />
          b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each party acknowledges
          that the Agreement contains the whole agreement between the parties
          and that it has not relied upon any oral or written representations
          made to it by the other. <br />
          c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may not incorporate
          any additional terms into the Booking Agreement other than the
          restrictions clearly included in your listing. You agree not to
          propose to the Buyer or Seller any additional terms or amendments to
          the Booking Agreement after a booking has been made without our
          consent. The Buyer is not obliged to accept any further terms once we
          have accepted a booking on your behalf.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Buyer Rights and Obligations</strong><br />
          a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buyer: <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject
          to clause (iv) below, is entitled to permit another person to use the
          Parking Space under this Agreement, so long as only one vehicle
          occupies the Parking Space at any point in time. <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is
          responsible for ensuring that any person (an "Authorized Person") the
          Buyer allows to use a Parking Space complies with the terms of this
          Agreement. The Buyer is responsible for the conduct of any such
          Authorized Person. <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          must only use the Parking Space at the times specified in this booking
          confirmation. If the Buyer uses the Parking Space at any earlier or
          later time, the Buyer will be liable to the Seller under the Booking
          Agreement and the Buyer’s vehicle may be towed or otherwise
          immobilized. <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must
          use the vehicle the details of which have been notified as part of the
          Booking. If the Buyer uses a different vehicle they may be unable to
          park. If the Buyer wishes to change the registered vehicle to be used
          for the Parking Space, the Buyer must contact AirGarage in advance of
          the booking so that AirGarage can confirm and notify the Seller.
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
          the Booking Period, if the Buyer has any concerns or queries about the
          Parking Space the Buyer must contact AirGarage immediately and
          AirGarage will direct the concern or query to the Seller if
          appropriate. <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vi.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
          the start of the Booking Period, the Buyer must inspect the Parking
          Space and ensure the Parking Space meets the description on the
          Website. If the Buyer believes that the Parking Space does not
          reasonably match the description on the Website, they must contact
          AirGarage immediately, in which case we will provide the Buyer with
          the Seller contact details in order to resolve the concern or query.
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where
          possible, any dispute between the Buyer and the Seller relating to the
          Parking Space should be dealt with at the start of the Booking Period
          and without our involvement so that the Buyer may still fulfill the
          Booking. Where this does not prove possible, the Buyer agrees that
          AirGarage may mediate (at its discretion) and attempt to resolve the
          concern or query so that the booking can be fulfilled. <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;viii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must
          vacate the Parking Space and cease using the Parking Space by the end
          of the Booking Period. The exact departure time from the Parking Space
          will be as stated in the Booking Confirmation. <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ix.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;acknowledges
          that the Parking Space is someone else's property and agrees not to
          access any other part of the property to which the Parking Space is
          attached, other than as reasonably required to directly access the
          Parking Space. <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has
          primary responsibility for the Buyer’s safety and the safety of their
          vehicle during the Booking Period and agrees that the Seller is not
          responsible for ensuring the Buyer’s or an Authorized Person’s safety,
          or the safety of your vehicle.

          <strong>Seller warranties:</strong><br />
          a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Seller represents and

        <li>
          <strong>Payment</strong><br />
          a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our standard policy is to
          collect a monthly payment owed by the Buyer for the Parking Space at
          the time the booking is made. We will collect full payment up front in
          the case of a short or medium-term booking (any booking of up to 1
          month).<br />
          b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For long-term bookings
          (any booking of more than 1 month) we will request a payment from the
          Buyer up front for the first month, and then we will request payment
          for 1 months' worth of the booking, or the remaining booking time,
          whatever is less, 3 days in advance until termination of the
          Booking.<br />
          c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are authorized by the
          Seller to accept payment from the Buyer on the Seller's behalf. If the
          Buyer has paid the full amount for the booking to AirGarage at the
          time the booking is made then no further payments are due to the
          Seller. The Seller accepts that payment of the fees for the Booking to
          AirGarage represents a full discharge of the Buyer's payment
          obligations for that booking.<br />
          d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Seller, you
          authorize AirGarage to accept and hold Buyer payments on your behalf.
          We will send the payment to you that we have received from the Buyer
          after the start of the Booking Agreement or after the start of the
          next payment period in the case of a long-term booking. We reserve the
          right to waive this escrow period.<br />
          e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AirGarage is entitled to
          process all transactions using your Account and is not required to
          check that you have authorized such transactions.<br />
          f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to register an
          account, you may be required to provide us with bank account, PayPal,
          credit or debit card details to enable us to make payments to you. We
          are also authorized in exceptional circumstances to use these details
          to deduct any payments you may owe to us or to a Buyer.<br />
          g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are responsible for
          paying all fees and applicable taxes, general services taxes, incomes
          taxes, goods and services taxes and other similar State and Federal
          taxes or other withholding and personal or company incomes taxes
          ("Taxes") under this agreement in a timely manner.<br />
          h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If your payment is not
          received or fails we may collect monies owed using other collection
          mechanisms and we reserve the right to charge you for all additional
          fees and expenses we may incur (including legal fees and costs) in
          attempting to collect fees through commencing collection efforts,
          using the services of an external debt collection agency or issuing
          legal proceedings.<br />
          i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once payment has been
          received we will send you the Confirmation Email which will include
          the Booking Period (which may be changed by agreement or termination
          as set out below) and contact information number for the Buyer<br />
          j. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You agree that we may
          issue you with invoices and receipts in electronic format by email or
          other method.

          <strong>Cancellation and Booking Guarantee</strong><br />
          a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All bookings are made
          subject to the cancellation policy as set out in this agreement and
          the Buyer and the Seller each agree to comply with the terms of the
          Cancellation Policy and authorize AirGarage to administer the
          Cancellation Policy, if necessary, by making refunds.<br />
          b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buyer must cancel
          their booking by contacting AirGarage via email and requesting a
          cancellation. Notice of cancellation will be deemed to be received at
          the point AirGarage receives a cancellation request for their booking.
          AirGarage is not responsible for any transmission failures.<br />
          c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Buyer fails to
          cancel the booking using the AirGarage cancellation procedure the
          Buyer will be liable for the full amount of the fees payable to the
          Seller and will not receive any refund whatsoever.<br />
          d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, as a Buyer
          you agree that if a Seller wishes to cancel a Booking they may do so
          through us and our Website. If we are required to process a
          cancellation, we will do so in accordance with the Cancellation
          Policy. If you have paid a booking deposit and are required to make
          further payments to a Seller under the Cancellation Policy you
          authorize us to collect payment on behalf of the Seller using the
          credit or debit card details you have supplied. We also reserve the
          right to cancel your Account and terminate this agreement if you do
          not make payment within the timeframes specified in the Cancellation
          Policy.<br />
          e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the avoidance of
          doubt, it is the Seller's responsibility to make any refund to which
          the Buyer may be entitled. However, if we are holding funds on behalf
          of the Seller we may (at our sole discretion) refund sums to the
          Buyer.<br />
          <strong>
            f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A full refund can be

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vi.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
          a space is advertised as having a booking guarantee, AirGarage may
          provide the Buyer a full refund if the above criteria are met in
          AirGarage’s absolute discretion and judgement, though it is not
          obliged to do so.<br />

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
          Seller must inform AirGarage and the Buyer with seven days’ notice, if
          the Seller wants to cancel a booking, then a refund covering the
          remaining booking period will be provided to the Buyer. <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Example:
          If the Seller cancels a booking in week 2 of an agreed 4-week
          agreement, then the Buyer is owed a refund for the 2 weeks lost.
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
          Buyer must inform AirGarage and the Seller, if the Buyer wants to
          cancel a booking <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
          a Buyer wants to cancel a booking that has more than 4 weeks to run,
          then the Buyer will not be refunded amounts paid up to and through the
          current 4 week billing period. Future invoices for the remaining,
          upcoming 4 week periods of the rental will be cancelled, effectively
          refunding any outstanding balance for the Booking that would have been
          charged for future use of the Parking Space. <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Example:
          If the Buyer cancels a booking in week 2 of a 14-week agreement, then
          they will not be refunded the payment they already made for the time
          period lasting through week 4 of the Booking. The Buyer will not be
          charged or will be refunded for the remaining 8 weeks.<br />
          <strong>h.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Refund</strong>
          <br />
          i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Buyer wants to
          cancel a Booking that has less than 1 month to run on the booking
          period, then the Buyer will receive no refund. <br />
